## Requirements

- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0 "Download .NET 6.0 SDK") / [.NET 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0 "Download .NET 7.0 SDK") / [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0 "Download .NET 8.0 SDK")

## Usages

- Asset Bundle
  - Run the executable.
  - Decrypt:  
    Just choose ENCRYPTED asset bundle(s) to decrypt. The output file should have `_DEC` suffix.
  - Encrypt:  
    The encryption process requires you to put the ORIGINAL and DECRYPTED asset bundle(s) at the same directory. The DECRYPTED asset bundle(s) file name MUST follow this rule: `Original Name_whatever you put there`. This tool will detect a file with the name before the UNDERSCORE.
